#### Code

The file 'game_grod.gd' is where the logic happens, a quick overview for it is as follows:
Player moves,
first, can the player move here?
if yes, move there, if no, don't
Next, forground and background
Any asset the player can stand on goes into the background
Any asset the player can NOT stand on goes in the forground
