# Critical features
## Game
### Movement 
- ~~The player should be able to move orthogonally in all directions.~~ 10/22/2024
- ~~Player should stop at walls~~ 10/22/2024
- ~~Player should be able to push boxes around~~ 10/22/2024

### Mechanics 
- Buttons, 
  - Button should be able to open door when box is pushed on it.
- Flag 
  - A flag that the player has to get to to beat the level. 
- 

### Level select

The level select is designed by Aidan, Here are some ideas for how it
should work.

#### Options for level select
- Level block, The level selection could be just like the regular
  game, but there would be a block that the player can walk into to
  select the level.

# Documentation
## Readme
A readme for this repo should be created, and it should have...
- Name of game
- Our names
- A short description of the game
- Instructions on how to compile the game. 
- Statement of the licenses of the program.
- Link to backlog
- Written in Markdown (https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

## Licensing 
- MIT license for our own code
- No software license for any code we want to take from third party should be more
  restrictive than MIT.
- Game assets should be free culture as defined by the creative
  commons. 
- We should have a document that lists the licenses for each file.
- We should have a document that lists the acceptable licenses for
  code and game assets. 

## Credits
- A document that credits all the outside work we've used.
- Video game credits where we credit the godot engine, and the authors
  of any assets/code we've used.

## Guidelines
We should have a set of guidelines for developing the game. 
[guidelines](guidelines.md)

## Requirements document
A document describing all of the current game requirements we have
should be made.

- Requirements spreadsheet.

# Ideas
This is a list of ideas for the game. These should be added after we
get the critical features done with.
