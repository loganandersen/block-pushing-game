# Documentation
## Readme
A readme for this repo should be created, and it should have...

- Statement of the licenses of the program. 

## Licensing 
- MIT license for our own code
- No software license for any code we want to take from third be more
  restrictive than MIT.
- Game assets should be free culture as defined by the creative
  commons. 
- We should have a document that lists the licenses for each file.
- We should have a document that lists the acceptable licenses for
  code and game assets. 

## Credits
- A document that credits all the outside work we've used.
- Video game credits where we credit the godot engine, and the authors
  of any assets/code we've used.

## Guidelines
We should have a set of guidelines for developing the game. 
[guidelines](guidelines.md)

## Requirements document
A document describing all of the current game requirements we have
should be made.

- Requirements spreadsheet.

# Ideas
