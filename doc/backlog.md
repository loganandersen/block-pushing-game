# Intro
This is the product backlog, It has a list of things that could or
should be done. 

Anybody can add to the backlog if they have ideas. 

# First Sprint (Minimum we need to get done for this sprint)
## Aidan
- Get pictures for blocks and add them to the assets folder
  - 
## James
- Get player to move
  - Player should move orthogonally in all directions
  - Player should stop at wall
## Logan 
- Create Github repo 
- ~~ Create Backlog ~~

# Critical features
## Game
### Movement 
- The player should be able to move orthogonally in all directions. 
- Player should stop at walls
- Player should be able to push boxes around

### Mechanics 
# Documentation
## Readme
A readme for this repo should be created, and it should have...
- Name of game 
- Our names
- A short description of the game
- Instructions on how to compile the game. 

## Licensing 
- MIT license for our own code
- No software license for any code we want to take from third be more
  restrictive than MIT.
- Game assets should be free culture as defined by the creative
  commons. 
- We should have a document that lists the licenses for each file.
- We should have a document that lists the acceptable licenses for
  code and game assets. 

## Credits
- A document that credits all the outside work we've used.
- Video game credits where we credit the godot engine, and the authors
  of any assets/code we've used.


## Requirements document
A document describing all of the current game requirements we have
should be made.

This might be the requirements spreadsheet, since the power point said
we need a requirements spreadsheet for the final.
