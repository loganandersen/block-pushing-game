# Guidelines
## Project guidelines
### Files
#### Filenames
- All files should be lowercase
- underlines should be used instead of spaces
- no misspellings

As an exception to this rule, if godot automatically generates a file
that does not conform, then it should be kept as it is, rather than
renamed. 

## Ethics 
- All source code should be open source, all assets should be released
  under a free license.
